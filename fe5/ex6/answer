i) As a process is started, the scheduler initializes the quantum counter inclock ticks for the process.
The clock driver decrements the quantum counter by 1, at every clock interrupt. When the counter gets to zero ,
clock driver calls the scheduler to set up another process. Thus clock driver helps in preventing processes from
running longer than time slice allowed.

ii) The clock also accounts for the CPU time the processes use. The most accurate way to do this is to start a second
timer, distinct from the main system timer, whenever a process is started. When that process is stopped, the timer
can be read out to tell how long the process has run
